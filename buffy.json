  "Buffy: I'm Buffy. I'm new.\nXander: Xander. Is - is me. Hi.\nBuffy: Um, thanks.\nXander: Well, uh, maybe I'll see you around... maybe at school... since we... both... go there.\nBuffy: Great! It was nice to meet you. [walks away]\nXander: We both go to school. Very suave. Very not pathetic.",
  "Buffy: [to Giles] To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you have to suck their blood. It's like a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they're just gonna kill you. Why am I still talking to you?",
  "Giles: The influx of the undead, the... supernatural occurrences, it's been building for years. There's a reason why you're here and a reason why it's now!\nBuffy: Because now is the time my mom moved here.\nGiles: Something's coming, something, something, something is - is gonna happen here. Soon!\nBuffy: Gee, can you vague that up for me?",
  "Willow: Well... when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty. Or at all. I-I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.\nBuffy: It's not that bad.\nWillow: No, i-it is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.\nBuffy: You really haven't been dating lately.",
  "Buffy: [about the mausoleum] Well, this is nice. I-it's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows... call it home!\nDarla: Who the hell are you?\nBuffy: You mean there's actually someone in this town who doesn't know already? Whew, that's a relief! I'm telling you, having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.\nXander: Buffy, we bail now, right?\nThomas: Not yet!\nBuffy: Okay, first of all, what's with the outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge!\n[The vampires close in on Buffy. She turns to Darla.]\nBuffy: Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there's just the hard way.\nDarla: That's fine with me!\nBuffy: Are you sure? Now, this is not gonna be pretty. We're talking violence, strong language, adult content...",
  "Giles: For as long as there have been vampires, there has been the Slayer. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One...\nBuffy: He loves doing this part.\nGiles: Alright. The Slayer hunts vampires, Buffy is a Slayer, don't tell anyone. Well, I think that's all the vampire information you need.",
  "Giles: [To Willow] Well then help me in researching this Harvest affair. It seems to be some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, hell on Earth. Quite charmless. I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. [about a computer] It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine. [everyone stares] That was a bit, um, British, wasn't it?\nBuffy: Welcome to the New World.",
  "Xander: This is just too much. I mean, yesterday my life's like, 'Uh-oh, pop quiz.' Today it's 'Rain of Toads'.\nWillow: I know. And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.\nXander: Nobody knows. It's like we've got this big secret.\nWillow: We do. That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't.",
  "[Vampires are terrorizing The Bronze, including a sired Jesse McNally]\nXander: We've gotta get in there before Jesse does something stupider than usual.\nGiles: Listen to me... Jesse is dead. You have to remember that when you see him, you're not looking at your friend. You're looking at the thing that killed him.",
  "Giles: It may be that we are all that stands between the Earth and utter destruction.\nBuffy: Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school.\nXander: Oh, yeah, that's a plan. Cause lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths.\nWillow: Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.\nBuffy: I was thinking of a more subtle approach, ya know, like excessive not-studying.\nGiles: [to himself as the others are walking away] The Earth is doomed.",
  "Giles: Why should someone want to harm Cordelia?\nWillow: Maybe because they met her? Did I say that?",
  "Willow: You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes!",
  "Xander: I laugh in the face of danger! Then I... hide until it goes away.",
  "Joyce: Look what I found. It's my yearbook from junior year. [finds her picture] Oh, look! There I am.\nBuffy: Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex. I am not ready to know that you had Farrah hair.\nJoyce: This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?",
  "Giles: This is madness. What could you have been thinking? You are the Slayer. Lives depend upon you. I make allowances for your youth, but I expect a certain amount of responsibility, instead of which you enslave yourself to this-this... cult.\n[we see Buffy is wearing a cheerleading outfit]\nBuffy: You don’t like the color?",
  "Giles: God, every day here is the same.\nBuffy: Bright, sunny, beautiful. However can we escape this torment?",
  "Xander: It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.",
  "Giles: This computer invasion that Willow's performing on the coroner's office... One assumes it is entirely legal?\nBuffy: [in unison] Of course.\nWillow: [in unison] Entirely.\nGiles: Right. Wasn't here. Didn't see it. Couldn't have stopped you.",
  "Principal Flutie: We all need help with our feelings. Otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug, [jumps back] but not a real hug! Because there's no touching, this school is sensitive to wrong touching.",
  "Cordelia: I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side. You know? Like how even used Mercedes still have leather seats.",
  "The Master: [reading from the writing of Aurelius] \"There will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him. And he will lead her into Hell.\" As it is written, so shall it be. \"Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him, and usher him to his immortal destiny.\" As it is written, so shall it be. \"And one of the Brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.\" Oh, wait... [grabs one of the Brethren by the throat] That's not written anywhere. The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer. If you fail to bring him to me... If you allow that girl to stop you... [throws the vampire into a coffin] Here endeth the lesson.",
  "Giles: [about Owen's book selection] Oh, Emily Dickinson.\nBuffy: We're both fans.\nGiles: Yes, she's quite a good poet. I mean for a...\nBuffy: [defensively] A girl?\nGiles: For an American.",
  "Willow: Buffy has a really important date.\nBuffy: Owen!\nGiles: All right, I-I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show.\nBuffy: Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.",
  "Giles: Well, you know what they say; ninety percent of the vampire slaying game is, is waiting.\nBuffy: You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?",
  "Buffy: If the apocalypse comes, beep me.",
  "Xander: We just saw the zebras mating. Thank you, very exciting!\nWillow: It was like the Heimlich... with stripes!",
  "Buffy: What is it with those guys?\nWillow: They're obnoxious. Professionally.\nXander: Well, every school has 'em. See, you start a new school, you get your desks, some blackboards and some mean kids.",
  "Willow: [to Xander] You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, \"Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?\" We've been through this.",
  "Giles: Xander's taken to teasing the less fortunate?\nBuffy: Uh-huh.\nGiles: And, there's been a noticeable change in both clothing and demeanor?\nBuffy: Yes.\nGiles: And, well, otherwise all his spare time is spent lounging about with imbeciles.\nBuffy: It's bad, isn't it?\nGiles: It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Of course you'll have to kill him.",
  "[While researching in the library]\nBuffy: Wow. Apparently, Noah rejected the hyenas from the Ark because he thought they were an evil impure mixture of dogs and cats.\nWillow: Hyenas aren't well liked.\nBuffy: They do seem to be the schmoes of the animal kingdom.\nWillow: Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy, or... or some ducks?",
  "Willow: [about Angel] So he is a good vampire? I mean on a scale of one to ten. Ten being someone who's killing and maiming every night, one being someone who's... not.",
  "Xander: I know you have feelings for this guy, but it's not like you're in love with him, right? [Buffy looks away] You’re in love with a vampire?! What are you, outta your mind?\nCordelia: What?!?\nXander: [to Cordelia] Not 'vampire' ... [to Buffy] How could you love an umpire? Everyone hates 'em!",
  "Angel: The elders conjured the most perfect punishment for me. They restored my soul.\nBuffy: What, they were all out of boils and blinding torment?\nAngel: When you become a vampire, the demon takes your body, but it doesn't get your soul; that's gone. No conscience, no remorse, it's an easy way to live. You have no idea what it's like to have done the things I've done...and care. I haven't fed on a human being since that day.",
  "Buffy: I invited you into my home and then you attacked my family.\nAngel: Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends... and their friends' children... For hundreds of years I offered ugly death to everyone I met, and I did it with a song in my heart.",
  "Darla: [about Angel] I made him. There was a time when we shared everything, wasn't there Angelus? You had a chance to come home, to rule with me in the Master's court for a thousand years, but you threw that away because of her. You love someone who hates us. You're sick. And you'll always be sick. And you'll always remember what it was like to watch her die.",
  "Giles: I'm just going to stay and clean up a little. I'll be back in the Middle Ages.\nJenny: Did you ever leave?",
  "Giles: I-I-I really don't know how to advise you. Things involved with a computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such I'd be more in my element.",
  "Jenny: You kids really dig the library, don't you?\nBuffy: We're literary.\nXander: To read makes our speaking English good.",
  "Xander: Are we over-reacting? He's in a computer, what can he do?\nBuffy: You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the world?\nGiles: Randomize traffic signals.\nBuffy: Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.\nGiles: Destroy the world's economy.\nBuffy: I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.\nGiles: ...Alright, yours was best.",
  "Xander: Hey! I got to hit someone!",
  "Jenny: Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?\nGiles: The smell.\nJenny: Computers don't smell, Rupert.\nGiles: I know. Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower, or a a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten. Books smell musty and-and-and rich. The knowledge gained from a computer is a - it, uh, it has no no texture, no-no context. It's-it's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, then-then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible, it should be, um, smelly.",
  "Giles: He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the students. I did try to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimize said contact, but he would have none of it.",
  "Principal Snyder: My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in my world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.",
  "Sid (the dummy): [about his present condition] Lets just say there was me, there was a really mean demon, there was a curse, and the next thing I know, I'm not me any more. I'm sitting on some guy's knee, with his hand up my shirt.",
  "[Marc has tricked Giles into getting into a craftily disguised guillotine.]\nGiles: Shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?\nMarc: No, no this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just come pouring out.\nGiles: What exactly is the trick?\nMarc: What trick?",
  "Buffy: What about the whole \"it's a demon\" theory?\nGiles: I'm looking into that, but my investigation is somewhat... hampered by our life in the theater.\nBuffy: Uh, priority check, Giles? (holding up her hands) Talent show, murder.\nXander: Yeah, we can't do the talent show, it's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it!\nGiles: Principal Snyder is watching us all very closely. Now, if he chooses, he can make all our lives extremely difficult. A Slayer cannot afford that! We will find this murderer, but in the meantime... the show must go on.\nBuffy: This is so unfair.",
  "Joyce: You want to go to school?\nBuffy: Sure! Why not?\nJoyce: Okay. Good day to buy that lottery ticket.",
  "Xander: Well, the Hellmouth, the center of mystical convergence, supernatural monsters: been there.\nBuffy: Little blasé there, aren't you?\nXander: I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party!\nBuffy: Thanks for having confidence in me.\nXander: You da man, Buff!",
  "[Xander knocks The Clown unconscious]\nXander: You were a lousy clown! Your balloon animals were pathetic! Everyone can make a giraffe!",
  "Xander: Our dreams are coming true?\nGiles: Dreams? That would be a musical comedy version of this. Nightmares, our--our nightmares are coming true.",
  "The Master: [to Buffy] What's the fun of burying someone if they're already dead?",
  "[The class is discussing 'The Merchant of Venice'.]\nMs. Miller: But has Shylock suffered? What's his place in Venice society?\nWillow: Well, everyone looked down on him.\nCordelia: That is such a twinkie defense. Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and she's trying to make it about her leg! Like my pain meant nothing.",
  "Principal Snyder: There are no dead students here. This week.",
  "Giles: Buffy told me you don't feed from humans anymore.\nAngel: Not for a long while.\nGiles: Is that why you're here? To see her?\nAngel: I can't. It's, uh... It's too hard for me to be around her.\nGiles: A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic... in a maudlin sort of way.",
  "Willow: 'Have a nice summer', 'Have a nice summer'. This girl had no friends at all.\nGiles: Once again I teeter at the precipice of the generational gap.\nBuffy: 'Have a nice summer' is what you write when you have nothing to say.\nXander: It's the kiss of death.",
  "Cordelia: So, are you saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?\nBuffy: That about sums it up.\nCordelia: Bummer for her. It's awful to feel that lonely.\nBuffy: Hmm. So you've read something about the feeling?\nCordelia: Hey! You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.\nBuffy: Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?\nCordelia: Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.",
  "Angel: [about the prophecy] Well, there's gotta be some way around it.\nGiles: Listen, some prophecies are-are a bit dodgy. They're-they're mutable. Buffy herself has-has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the Codex. There is nothing in it that does not come to pass.\nAngel: Then you're reading it wrong.\nGiles: I wish to God I were. But it's very plain. Tomorrow night Buffy will face the Master, and she will die.",
  "Buffy: [about the prophecy in which she will die] So that's it, huh? I remember the drill. One slayer dies, the next one's called. I wonder who she is. Will you train her? Or will they send someone else?\nGiles: Buffy... I...\nBuffy: [whimpering] Does it say how he's gonna kill me? Do you think it'll hurt? [as Angel steps close to her] Don't touch me! Were you even gonna tell me?\nGiles: I was hoping I wouldn't have to, that there was some way around it. I...\nBuffy: I've got a way around it. I quit.\nAngel: It's not that simple.\nBuffy: I'm making it that simple. I quit. I resign, I-I'm fired, you can find someone else to stop The Master from taking over.\nGiles: I'm not sure that anyone else can. All the... the signs indicate...\nBuffy: [enraged, throwing books at Giles] The signs?! Read me the signs! Tell me my fortune! You're so useful sitting here with all of your books! You're really a lot of help!\nGiles: I don't suppose I am\nAngel: I know this is hard.\nBuffy: What do you know about this? You're never gonna die\nAngel: You think I want anything to happen to you? You think I could stand it? We just gotta figure out a way...\nBuffy: I already did. I quit, remember. Pay attention!\nGiles: Buffy, if the Master rises...\nBuffy: I don't care! I don't care. Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.",
  "The Master: You're dead.\nBuffy: I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.\nThe Master: You were destined to die! It was written!\nBuffy: What can I say? I flunked the written.",
  "The Master: Where are your jibes now? Will you laugh when my Hell is on Earth?\nBuffy: You're that amped about Hell? Go there!",
  "Buffy: It's just...been a really weird day.\nXander: Yeah. Buffy died and everything.\nWillow: Wow. Harsh.\nGiles: I should've known that wouldn't stop you.",
  "Cordelia: Oh, look, it's the Three Musketeers.\n[The others look at each other.]\nBuffy: [to Xander] Was that an insult?\nXander: Kinda lacked punch.\nWillow: The Three Musketeers were cool.\nCordelia: I see your point.\nXander: I woulda gone with Stooges.\nCordelia: Well, I just meant that you guys always hang out together. So, did you guys fight any demons this summer?\nWillow: Uh, yes! Our own personal demons.\nXander: Uh, such as, as, as lust and, uh, thrift!\nBuffy: I would have to go with Stooges also.",
  "Cordelia: Buffy. You're really campaigning for bitch-of-the-year, aren't you?\nBuffy: As defending champion, you nervous?\nCordelia: [scoffs] I can hold my own. You know, we've never really been close, which is good, 'cause I don't really like you that much. But you have been known to save the world on occasion, so I'm going to give you a piece of advice.\nBuffy: Which is?\nCordelia: Get over it.\nBuffy: Excuse me?\nCordelia: Whatever is causing the Joan Collins 'tude, deal with it. Embrace the pain, spank your inner moppet, whatever, but get over it. 'Cause pretty soon you're not even gonna have the loser friends you've got now.",
  "Willow: She's possessed!\nGiles: Possessed?\nWillow: That's the only explanation that makes any sense. I mean, you should've seen her last night. That wasn't Buffy.\nXander: Are we overlooking the idea that she may be very attracted to me? [gets looks from the others and concedes] She's possessed.\nGiles: Possessed by what?\nWillow: Aaaaa possessing thing!\nGiles: [sarcastically] Well, that narrows it down.\nXander: Well, you're the expert. Hey, maybe when the Master killed her some... mystical bad guy transference thing happened.\nWillow: That's what it was! I mean, why else would she be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h?\nGiles: Willow, I think we're all a little too old to be spelling things out.\nXander: A bitcuh?",
  "Angel: We need to distract the vampires.\nBuffy: Right.\nAngel: What are you gonna do?\nBuffy: I'm gonna kill them all. That oughta distract 'em.",
  "Cordelia: What an ordeal. And you know what the worst part is?\nJenny: What?\nCordelia: It stays with you forever. No matter what they tell you, none of that rust and blood and grime comes out. I mean, you can dry-clean till Judgment Day, you are living with those stains.\nJenny: Yeah that's the worst part of being hung upside down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat. The stains.",
  "Buffy: Are you jealous?\nAngel: [laughs a bit] Of Xander? Please. He's just a kid.\nBuffy: Is it 'cause I danced with him?\nAngel: Danced with is a pretty loose term. Mated with might be a little closer.\nBuffy: Don't you think you're being a little unfair? It was one little dance, which I only did to make you crazy, by the way. Behold my success.\nAngel: I am not jealous.\nBuffy: You're not jealous? What, vampires don't get jealous?\nAngel: See? Whenever we fight you always bring up the vampire thing.",
  "Xander: [digging in the grave yard as the girls watch] Y'know, this might go a lot faster if you femmes actually picked up a shovel, too.\nGiles: [stopping, almost breathless] Hear, hear.\nBuffy: Sorry, but I'm an old fashioned gal. I was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies.",
  "Xander: So, both coffins are empty. That makes three girls signed up for the army of zombies.\nWillow: Is it an army if you just have three?\nBuffy: Zombie drill team then.",
  "Buffy: I don't get it. Why would anybody wanna make a girl?\nXander: [bitterly] You mean when there's so many pre-made ones just laying around? The things we do for love.\nBuffy: Love has nothing to do with this.\nXander: Maybe not, but I'll tell you this: people don't fall in love with what's right in front of them. People want the dream. What they can't have. The more unattainable, the more attractive.",
  "Xander: Well, I guess that makes it official. Everybody's paired off. Vampires get dates. Hell, even the school librarian sees more action than me. You ever think that the world is a giant game of musical chairs, and the music's stopped and we're the only ones who don't have a chair?\nWillow: All the time.\nCordelia: Xander? I just wanted to thank you for saving my life. What you did in there was really brave and heroic, and I just wanted to tell you if there was anything that I could ever do to...\nXander: Do you mind? We're talking here. [Cordelia is taken aback, rolls her eyes and leaves] So where were we?\nWillow: Wondering why we never get dates.\nXander: Yeah, so why do you think that is?",
  "\"Big Ugly\": This weekend, the night of St. Vigeous, our power shall be at its peak. When I kill her, it'll be the greatest event since the crucifixion. And I should know. I was there.\nSpike: You were there? Please! If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion actually was there, it would've been like Woodstock.\n\"Big Ugly\": I oughta rip your throat out.\nSpike: I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move...\n[\"Big Ugly\" rushes at Spike, who punches him out without even looking]\nSpike: [to the Anointed One] So, who do you kill for fun around here?\nThe Anointed One: Who are you?\nSpike: Spike. You're that Anointed guy. I read about you. You've got Slayer problems. That's a bad piece of luck. Do you know what I find works real good with Slayers? Killing them.\nThe Anointed One: Can you?\nSpike: [glancing at \"Big Ugly\"] A lot faster than Nancy-boy there. Yeah, I did a couple Slayers in my time. I don't like to brag... [scoffs] Who am I kidding? I love to brag!",
  "Buffy: We were at the Bronze before. Thought you said you might show.\nAngel: You said you weren't sure if you were going.\nBuffy: I was being cool. C'mon, you've been dating for, what, like, two hundred years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show?\nWillow: Wow. Two centuries of dating. If you only had two a year, that's still like 400 dates with 400 different... [awkward beat.] Why do they call it a mace?",
  "Angel: I taught you to always guard your perimeter. [tuts] You should have someone out there.\nSpike: I did. I'm surrounded by idiots. What's new with you?\nAngel: Everything.\nSpike: Yeah. Come up against this slayer yet?\nAngel: She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave her the puppy dog \"I'm all tortured\" act. Keeps her off my back when I feed.\nSpike: People still fall for that Anne Rice routine? What a world!\nXander: [to Angel] I knew you were lying. Undead liar guy.",
  "Spike: You think you can fool me?! You were my sire, man! You were my... Yoda!\nAngel: Things change.\nSpike: Not us! Not demons! Man, I can't believe this. You Uncle Tom! Come on people! This isn't a spectator sport!",
  "Spike: [holding a pole] Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a nice ripe [turns to see Buffy, holding an axe] ...girl.\nBuffy: Do we really need weapons for this?\nSpike: I just like them, they make me feel all manly.\n[They both drop their weapons]\nSpike: The last Slayer I killed - she begged for her life. You don't strike me as the begging kind.\nBuffy: You shouldn't have come here.\nSpike: No. I've messed up your doilies and stuff. But I just got so bored! I'll tell you what. As a personal favor from me to you, I'll make it quick. It won't hurt a bit.\nBuffy: No, Spike. It's gonna hurt a lot.",
  "Spike: [destroying the Anointed One] From now on, we're gonna have a little less ritual, and a little more fun around here!",
  "Giles: You have responsibilities that other girls do not.\nBuffy: Oh! I know this one! Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah blah biddy blah, I'm so stuffy, give me a scone.\nGiles: It's as if you know me.",
  "Devon MacLeish: What does a girl have to do to impress you?\nOz: Well, it involves a feather boa and the theme to A Summer Place. I can't discuss it here.\nDevon: You're too picky, man. Do you know how many girls you could have? You're lead guitar, Oz. It's currency!\nOz: I'm not picky. You're just impressed by any pretty girl that can walk and talk.\nDevon: She doesn't have to talk.",
  "Ampata: You are always thinking of others before yourself. You remind me of someone from very long ago. The Inca Princess.\nBuffy: Cool! A princess.\nAmpata: They told her that she was the only one. That only she could defend her people from the nether world. Out of all the girls in her generation... she was the only one... chosen. Do you know the story?\nBuffy: It's fairly familiar.\nAmpata: She was sixteen, like us. She was offered as a sacrifice and went to her death. Who knows what she had to give up to fulfill her duty to others?",
  "Xander: Okay, I have something to tell you. And it's kind of a secret, and it's, um, a little bit scary. I like you. A lot. And I want you to go to with me the dance.\nAmpata: [laughs] Why was that so scary?\nXander: Well, because you never know if a girl's gonna say 'yes', or if... she's gonna laugh in your face and pull out your still beating heart and crush it into the ground with her heel.\nAmpata: Hmm. Then you are very courageous.",
  "Xander: I just, present company excluded, I have the worst taste in women of anyone in the world, ever.\nBuffy: Ampata wasn't evil. At least not to begin with, and... I-I do think she cared about you.\nXander: Yeah, but I think that whole sucking the life out of people thing would have been a strain on the relationship.\nBuffy: She was gypped. She was just a girl, and she had her life taken away from her. I remember how I felt when I heard the prophecy that I was gonna die. I wasn't exactly obsessed with doing the right thing.\nXander: Yeah, but you did. You gave up your life.\nBuffy: I had you to bring me back.",
  "Angel: I knew this was gonna happen.\nBuffy: What? What do you think is happening?\nAngel: You're 16 years old, I'm 241.\nBuffy: I've done the math.\nAngel: You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what you want.\nBuffy: Oh, no, I, I think I do. I want out of this conversation.\nAngel: Listen, if we date, you and I both know one thing's going to lead to another.\nBuffy: One thing already has led to another. You think it's a little late to be reading me a warning label?\nAngel: I'm just trying to protect you. This could get out of control.\nBuffy: Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?\nAngel: [grabs her roughly] This isn't some fairy tale.

  "Buffy: Well, say it.\nXander: I'm not gonna say it.\nWillow: You lied to Giles.\nXander: 'Cause she will.\nBuffy: I wasn't lying. I was just... protecting him from information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly.\nXander: Like a corn dog.\nWillow: Like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably an orgy.\nXander: Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho, rewind. Since when do they have orgies, and why aren't I on the mailing list?\nBuffy: There's no orgies!",
  "Buffy: Angel barely says two words to me.\nXander: Don't you hate that?\nBuffy: And when he does, he treats me like I'm a child.\nXander: That bastard!\nBuffy: You know, at least Tom can carry on a conversation.\nXander: Yeah! [pause] Tom? Who's Tom?\nWillow: The frat guy.\nXander: Oh, Buffy, I don't think so. Frying pan, fire? You know what I'm sayin'?",
  "Giles: She lied to me?\nWillow: Well...\nAngel: Did... she have a date?\nWillow: [to Angel] Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off! [to Giles] And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty! [to Angel] And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee?? [Awkward beat] Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've got to help Buffy.",
  "Buffy: I told one lie, I had one drink.\nGiles: Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words \"let that be a lesson\" are a tad redundant at this juncture.",
  "Willow: It's too bad we can't sneak a look at the Watcher Diaries and read up on Angel. I'm sure it's full of fun facts to know and tell.\nBuffy: Yeah. It's too bad. That stuff is private.\nWillow: Also Giles keeps them in his office. In his personal files.\nBuffy: Most importantly, it would be wrong.\n[cut to Willow and Buffy sneaking into the library]",

I just think you're trying to scare me off 'cause you're afraid of the competition. Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer.",

Why'd you think I'd like you better dressed that way?\nBuffy: I just wanted to be a real girl for once. The kind of fancy girl you liked when you were my age.\nAngel: Oh, ho.\nBuffy: What?\nAngel: I hated the girls back then. Especially the noblewomen.\nBuffy: You did.\nAngel: They were just incredibly dull. Simpering morons, the lot of them. I always wished I could meet someone ... exciting. Interesting.\nBuffy: Really? Interesting how?\nAngel: You know how.\nBuffy: Still, I had a really hard day. You should probably tell me.\nAngel: You're right. I should.\nBuffy: Definitely.",
  "Cordelia: I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie Antoinette. I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort. And I know the peasants were all depressed ...\nXander: I think you mean oppressed.\nCordelia: Whatever. They were cranky. So they're like, \"Let's lose some heads.\" Uh! That's fair. And Marie-Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have cake!",
  "Willow: Uh, Angel? If I say something you really don't want to hear, do you promise not to bite me?\nAngel: Are you going to tell me that I'm jealous?\nWillow: Well, you do sometimes get that way.\nAngel: You know, I never used to. Things used to be pretty simple. A hundred years, just hanging out, feeling guilty ... I really honed my brooding skills. Then she comes along. Yeah, I get jealous. But I know people.

I don't know if I trust you.\nAngel: Maybe you shouldn't do either.\nBuffy: Maybe I'm the one who should decide!\nAngel: I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire. Drusilla was the worst. She was ... an obsession of mine. She was pure, and sweet, and chaste.\nBuffy: And you made her a vampire.\nAngel: First I made her insane. Killed everybody she loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise. She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy orders, I turned her into a demon.\nBuffy: Well. I asked for the truth.",

Does it get easy?\nGiles: What do you want me to say?\nBuffy: Lie to me.\nGiles: Yes, it's terribly simple.

I see.\nOz: The monkey is the only cookie animal that gets to wear clothes, you know that... You have the sweetest smile I've ever seen...

I just have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life.\nAngel: No, but maybe your mom does.\nBuffy: Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom.\nAngel: Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.\nBuffy: Okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. Does it have to be Ted?\nAngel: Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?\nBuffy: My dad? Yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen.

I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's doomed to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again, and... Forgiveness is impossible.\nBuffy: Good. He doesn't deserve it.\nGiles: To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's not done because people deserve it, it's done because they need it.\nBuffy: No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with.\nXander: He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.",

They're called winners.

Because I want you so badly! I want to take comfort in you. And I know it will cost me my soul, and a part of me doesn't care. I'm weak. I've never been anything else. It's not the demon that needs killing in me, Buffy. It's the man.\nBuffy: You're weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. Maybe this evil did bring you back, but if it did, it's because it needs you. And that means you can hurt it. Angel, you have the power to do real good, to make amends. But if you die right now, then all that you ever were was a monster.

[whispers] I can't.\nAngel: Buffy, please. Just this once, let me be strong.\nBuffy: Strong is fighting! It's hard, and it's painful, and it's every day. It's what we have to do. And we can do it together. But if you're too much of a coward for that, then burn. If I can't convince you that you belong in this world, then I don't know what can. But do not expect me to watch.

Of course that place is nowhere near this place.\nGiles: Some demons thrive by fostering hatred and, and, uh, persecution amongst the mortal animals. Not by, not by destroying men, but by watching men destroy each other. Now, they feed us our darkest fear and turn peaceful communities into vigilantes.\nBuffy: Hansel and Gretel run home to tell everyone about the mean old witch.\nGiles: And then she and probably dozens of others are persecuted by a righteous mob.

It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in.\nBuffy: I kind of love you.\nWillow: And, besides, I have a shot at being a bad-ass Wicca, and what better place to learn?\nBuffy: I feel the need for more sugar than the human body can handle.\nWillow: Mochas?\nBuffy: Yes please! [the two get up and walk away] It's weird. You look at something and you think you know exactly what you're seeing, and then you find out it's something else entirely.\nWillow: Neat, huh?\nBuffy: Sometimes it is.",
  "Anya: The power of the Wish made me a righteous sword to smite the unfaithful.\nXander: Well, hey! Good luck with that. Hope it works out for you.\nAnya: You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millennium of treachery and oppression from the males of the species, and I have nothing but contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.\nXander: Then why you talking to me?\nAnya: [averting her eyes] I don't have a date for the prom.\nXander: Well, gosh! I wonder why not. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with your sales pitch?\nAnya: Men are evil... Will you go with me?\nXander: One of us is very confused, and I honestly don't know which.\n...\nAnya: When I lost my powers I got stuck with this persona, and now I have all these feelings. I don't understand it. I don't like it. All I know is I really want to go to this dance and I want someone to go with me.\n...\nAnya: Look, I know you find me attractive. I've seen you looking at my breasts.\nXander: Nothing personal, but when a guy does that it just means his eyes are open.\nAnya: Whatever. Look, do you wanna go with me or not?\n[Xander's eyes lower for a second, then flick back up to Anya's face.]",

  "Buffy: You guys are going to have a prom. The kind of prom that everyone should have. I'm going to give you all a nice, fun, normal evening, if I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it.\nXander: ...Yay?",
  "Wesley: Mr. Giles. I'd like your opinion. While the last thing I wish to do is model bad behavior in front of impressionable youth, I wonder if asking Miss Chase to dance would--\nGiles: For God's sake man, she's eighteen! And you have the emotional maturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it would you, and stop fluttering about.",
  "Jonathan: This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guess there were a lot of write-in ballots, and, um, well, the prom committee asked me to read this... We're not good friends. Most of us never found the time to get to know you, but that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.\nCrowd outbursts: Zombies! . . . Hyena people! . . . Snyder! [laughter]\nJonathan: But whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say that the Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history... [applause from the crowd]... And we know at least part of that is because of you. So the senior class offers its thanks, and gives you, uh, this. [produces a glittering, miniature umbrella with a small plaque attached to the shaft] It's from all of us, and it has written here, \"Buffy Summers, Class Protector.\"\n[The crowd breaks into sustained applause and cheering.]",
  "[After Willow and Harmony have signed each other's yearbooks.]\nWillow: I'm going to miss her.\nBuffy: Don't you hate her?\nWillow: Yes, with a fiery vengeance. She picked on me for ten years. Vacuous tramp... It's like a sickness, Buffy. I'm missing everything. I miss P.E.!",
  "Anya: So I was wondering... maybe if you're free this weekend... we could do some... entertaining thing.\nXander: Would that be along the lines of you telling me all about the men you destroyed back in your demon days? 'Cause pencil me in!\nAnya: Well, we could do something else you like. We could, um, watch sports of some kind.\nXander: Uh, I don't know.\nAnya: Men like sports. I'm sure of it.\nXander: Yes, men like sports. Men watch the action movie, they eat of the beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms. A thousand years of avenging our wrongs, and that's all that you've learned?",

  "Willow: I think we could be dead in two days and you're being ironic, detachment guy.\nOz: Would it help you if I panic?\nWillow: Yes! It'd be swell. Panic is a thing people can share in times of crisis. And everything's really scary now, you know? And I don't know what's going to happen. A-a-and there's all sorts of things that you're supposed to get to do after high school, and I was really looking forward to doing them, and now we're probably just going to die, and I'd like to feel that maybe you would --\n[Oz kisses her.]\nWillow: What are you doing?\nOz: Panicking.\n[Oz kisses Willow again, they fall onto Willow's bed.]",

Besides, it's Buffy's, and she's Slay Gal, you know, Little Miss Likes-to-fight. So...\nXander: I think there was a 'yea' vote buried in there somewhere.\n...\nAngel: Well, he's not crazy about germs.\nCordelia: Of course. That's it! We'll attack him with germs!\nBuffy: Great! We'll get him cornered, and then you can sneeze on him.\nCordelia: No! No. We'll get a container of Ebola virus, and... and, um... or -- it doesn't even have to be real. We could just get a box that says \"Ebola\" on it, and, um... [snaps her fingers] chase him. [everyone is silent] ...With the box.\nXander: I'm starting to lean towards the hummus offensive.\nOz: He'll never see it coming.",

  "Snyder: Congratulations to the class of 1999. You all proved more or less adequate. This is a time of celebration, so sit still and be quiet... Spit out that gum. Please welcome our distinguished guest speaker, Richard Wilkins the Third. I saw that gesture. You see me after graduation.",
  "Mayor Wilkins: Well, what a day this is! Special day. Today is our centennial, the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale, and I know what that mean to all you kids: not a darn thing. Because today something much more important happens. Today you all graduate from high school. Today all the pain, all the work, all the excitement is finally over. And what's a hundred years of history compared to that? You know what, kids?\nBuffy: Oh my God. He's going to do the entire speech.\nWillow: Man, just ascend already.\nBuffy: Evil!\nMayor Wilkins: ... for all of you it may be that there is a place in Sunnydale's history, whether you like it or not. It's been a long road getting here. For you. For Sunnydale. There was been achievement, joy, good times. And there has been grief. There's been loss. Some people who should be here today... aren't. But we are. Journeys end. And what is a journey? Is it just... distance travelled, time spent? No. It's what happens on the way, it's the things that shape you. At the end of the journey, you're not the same. Today is about change. Graduation doesn't just mean your circumstances change, it means you do. You ascend... to a higher level. Nothing will ever be the same. Nothing.\n[Everyone looks up, noticing the sun being blocked by an eclipse. The Mayor suddenly starts flinching]\nMayor Wilkins: And so, as we look back on... on the events that brought us to this day... we... we must all-- [cries out in pain] It has begun. My destiny. It's a little sooner than I expected. I had this whole section on civic pride. But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish!",

  "Buffy: [about college] It's nice that you're excited.\nWillow: It's just that in High School, knowledge was pretty much frowned upon, you really had to work to learn anything. But here... the energy, the collective intelligence, it's like this force. This penetrating force.. and I can just feel my mind opening up, you know, and letting this place just thrust into and spurt knowledge into... [considers what she's saying] That sentence ended up in a different place than it started out in.",
  "Willow: [spots Oz] Ooh, boyfriend! It's my on campus boyfriend!\nBuffy: Oh no, I forgot to pick mine up, the line's probably really long now too.",

  "Buffy: You saw the Grand Canyon?\nXander: Well, I saw the movie Grand Canyon, on cable. Really lame.\nBuffy: Huh?\nXander: Basically, I got as far as Oxnard and the engine fell out of my car, and that was literally. So I ended up washing dishes at the fabulous \"Ladies Night\" club for about a month and a half while I tried to pay for the repairs. Nobody really bothered me, or even spoke to me, until one night, when one of the male strippers called in sick, and no power on this earth will make me tell you the rest of that story. Suffice to say, I traded my car in for one that wasn't entirely made of rust, came trundling back home to the arms of my loving parents, where everything is exactly as it was, except I sleep in the basement and I have to pay rent. How's college?\nBuffy: Male strippers?\nXander: No power on this earth!",
  "Xander: Buffy, this is all about fear. It's understandable, but you can't let it control you. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to anger. - No, wait, hold on. - Fear leads to hate. Hate leads to the dark side. - Hold on, no. Ahm... First you get the women, then you get the money, then you... - OK, can we forget that?\nBuffy: Thanks for Dadaist pep talk. I feel much more abstract now.\nXander: The point is, you're Buffy.\nBuffy: Yeah. Maybe in high school I was Buffy.\nXander: And now in college you're Betty Louise?\nBuffy: Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnick of East Cupcake, Illinois. I might as well be.\nXander: [...] Let me tell you something. When it's dark and I'm all alone, and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever, I always think “What would Buffy do?” You're my hero. OK, sometimes when it's dark and I'm all alone, I think “What is Buffy wearing?”",
  "Willow: And you thought your days of sneaking out of your room were over.\nBuffy: No such luck. Kathy's nice and all, but she's... she's sort of... I don't know, like 'mini-mom of Momdonia.'",

  "Buffy: ... so then Kathy's like, \"It's share time.\" And I'm like, \"Oh yeah? Share this!\"\n[She punches the air.]\nOz: So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine for her.\nBuffy: Well, I didn't do either, actually. But she deserves it, don't you think?\nOz: Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.",
  "Buffy: [about Kathy] You're right. Ooh! She's even affecting my work, now. She's the Titanic. She's a crawling black cancer!\n[She brings her foot up, around and down onto a bench, breaking it in two.]\nBuffy: She's... other really bad things.\nOz: On the plus side you've killed the bench, which was looking shifty.",
  "Willow: [on the phone with Rupert Giles] Giles, I just talked to Buffy and, yeah, I think she's feeling a little... insane. [pause] No, not bitchy crazy, more like... homicidal maniac crazy. So I told her to come see you, OK?",
  "Anya: I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes, in my dreams, you're all naked.\nXander: Really? You know, if I'm in the checkout lane at the Wal-Mart, I've had that same one.",
  "Buffy: What's the matter, Spike? Dru dump you again?\nSpike: Maybe I dumped her!\nHarmony: She left him for a fungus demon. That's all he talks about most days.\nSpike: Harm!",
  "Anya: I like you. You're funny and you're nicely shaped. And, frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. Please remove your clothing now.\nXander: And the amazing thing? Still more romantic than Faith.",
  "Oz: [Looking through Giles's albums] Ok, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm moving in.\nGiles: Oz, there are more important things than records right now.\nOz: [Holds up Loaded by The Velvet Underground] More important than this one?\nGiles: Well, I suppose an argument could be made for--\nXander: Whoa! Giles has a TV! Everybody... Giles has a TV, he's shallow like us!",

I only said that because I thought that's what you wanted to hear.\nXander: Well, that's the funny thing about me. I tend to hear the actual words people say and accept them at face value.\nAnya: That's stupid.\nXander: I accept that.",
  "Willow: [about her costume] I'm Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common, seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake, plus she has that close relationship with God.\nXander: [to Oz] And you are?\n[Oz opens his jacket and reveals a name tag that says \"God.\"]\nXander: Of course. I wish I'd thought of that before I put down my deposit. I could've been God.\nOz: Blasphemer.\n(Buffy, Xander, Willow and Oz met some strange men in masks with guns and walks past them)\nBuffy: Nice costumes. Very Stealthy.\nWillow: Who are they supposed to be?\nOz: Nato?\nXander': Oh, I uh invited Anya over to join us, but; she is having some trouble finding a scary costume and she'll probably meet us there.\nBuffy: Perfect! Everyone's got a date except a third wheel Buffy.\nWillow: You're not a third wheel\nXander: Technically speaking, you're a fifth wheel.\nWillow: We're gonna have the best time.",

The Bringer of Terror! Tremble before me!

Who's a little fear demon?\nGiles: Don't taunt the fear demon.\nXander: Why, can he hurt me?\nGiles: No, it's just... tacky. Being doesn't matter.

  "Willow: Aren't you too young to be a bartender?\nXander: Au contraire, mon frere.\nBuffy: Mon frere means brother.\nXander: Mon girl-frere. Behold! [holds up a fake ID]\nWillow: I don't believe this is entirely on the up and up.\nXander: What gives it away?\nWillow: Looking at it.",
  "Willow: Buffy that is my best friend you need to think about not Parker. He's no good. There are men, better men, wherein the mind is stronger than the penis.\nXander: Nothing can defeat the penis! [looks around] Too loud, very unseemly.",

  "Xander: And was there a lesson in all this? huh? What did we learn about beer?\nBuffy: Foamy.\nXander: Good, just as long as that's clear. Anyways I think the boys in the car are contained for the time being. This'll give them some time to ponder the geo-political ramifications of being mean to me!",
  "Willow: The Bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?\nBuffy: 'Cause of the gloating factor alone, you know? We're all about college, now. We've got heady discourse.\nOz: Yeah, curfew-free nights of mom and pop-less hootenanny.\nXander: Co-ed dating prospects who find townies sexy and dangerous. What? I can dream.\nBuffy: Right. So if college is so great, what are we doing here and why is it more fun?\nWillow: Because the Bronze is nice and familiar.

  "Willow: OK, say that I help and you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love.

Oh! {he tries again] Ow! Damn it!\nWillow: Maybe you're trying too hard. Doesn't this happen to every vampire?\nSpike: Not to me it doesn't.\nWillow: It's me, isn't it?\nSpike: What are you talking about?\nWillow: Well, you came looking for Buffy, then settled. You didn't wanna bite me. I just happened to be around.\nSpike: Piffle.\nWillow: I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always like, \"Oooh, you're like a sister to me,\" or, \"Oh, you're such a good friend.\"\nSpike: Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.\nWillow: Really?\nSpike: Thought about it.\nWillow: When?\nSpike: Remember last year, you had on that, uh, fuzzy pink number with the lilac underneath?\nWillow: I never would've guessed.

Yeah...Good luck.\nWillow: If we could talk to him--\nSpike: You exterminated his race. What could you possibly say that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here.

There's some great spells that work much better with an ear in the mix.\nBuffy: That's one fun little hobby you've got there, Will.\nWillow: Or... or maybe an ear-harvesting demon that--it's, like, building another demon completely out of ears. Or... ooh! Thought. We're just assuming someone else cut off the ear. What if it was self-inflicted, like Van Gogh?\nBuffy: So... she brutally stabs herself, dumped the body, then cut off her own ear?\nWillow: No. She cut off her ear, then killed herself, then dumped the body--I'm really off my game, aren't I?",

[Willow starts to sneak up behind Faith and is about to hit her with her backpack] Try it, Red, and you lose an arm. [Willow backs off] I wake up to find that this blonde chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about. I mean, she's moved on to the first college beef stick she meets. And not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, she's forgot about the chick she nearly killed for him. So that's my dream... that and some stuff about cigars and tunnel.

You served your purpose. You squirted out the kid, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead! I mean, nobody cares! Nobody remembers! Especially not Buffy-fabulous-super-hero!

  "Government Consel: [about the Initiative] It was an experiment. The Initiative represented the Government's interests in not only controlling the otherworldly menace, but harnessing its power for our own military purposes. The considered opinion of this counsel is that this experiment has failed. Once the prototype took control of the complex, our soldiers suffered a 40% casualty rate. Only through the actions of the deserter and a group of civilian insurrectionists that our losses were not total. I trust the irony of that is not lost on any of us. Maggie Walsh's vision was brilliant, but ultimately unsupportable. The demons cannot be harnessed. The end result cannot be controlled. It is therefore our recommendation that this project be terminated and all records concerning it expunged. Our soldiers'll be debriefed. Standard confidentiality clause. We will monitor the civilians and usual measures prepared should they try to go public. I don't think they will. The Initiative itself will be filled in with concrete. Burn it down, gentlemen.

His story gets out, and suddenly everybody knows how to kill us, the mirror bit...!\nRiley: But he's not just a regular vampire. He has special powers, right?\nSpike: Nothing but showy Gypsy stuff. What's it to you, anyway?\nRiley: He's in town, making his presence known.\nSpike: [more intrigued] Drac's in Sunnydale? Guess the old boy needed closure after all.",

[puts it down, then looks at her hand in surprise] Right. That... was not... you. [sounding unconvinced] I did that. I did that because ... I wanted to.\n[Dracula watches her]\nBuffy: [looks nervously around her] Maybe I should rethink that thrall thing. [whimpers a little]",

I won't be taking drama with you.\nWillow: What? You have to, you promised!\nBuffy: Well, I know, but Giles says that it just -\nWillow: The hell with Giles!\nGiles: I can hear you, Willow.\nWillow: Drama is just Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, you can blow off training Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, can't you?\nBuffy: What happened to you people gotta respect a work ethic?\nWillow: Other people, not me!

This is exactly the same, except people pay for the things they don't return. It'll give me focus, increase my resources. And it'll prevent you lot from trampling all over my flat at all hours.

What's the [Mimics gesture] all about?\nRiley: It means yell real loud, so the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.",
  "Buffy: Look, I realize that every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package. But I want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto.

The journals just stop.\nGiles: Well, I suppose if they're anything like me they just find the whole subject too—\nBuffy: Unseemly? Damn, love ya, but you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.\nGiles: Painful, I was going to say.

But you can kill a hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand and the armies of Hell besides, and all we need is for one of us, just one, sooner or later, to have the thing we're all hoping for.\nBuffy: And that would be what?\nSpike: [whispers in her ear] One... good... day.",
  "Spike: The first was all business, but the second -- she had a touch of your style. She was cunning, resourceful... oh, did I mention? Hot. I could have danced all night with that one.\nBuffy: You think we're dancing?\nSpike: That's all we've ever done. And the thing about the dance is, you never get to stop. Every day you wake up, it's the same bloody question that haunts you: \"Is today the day I die?\" Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day. That final gasp. That look of peace. Part of you is desperate to know: \"What's it like? Where does it lead you?\" And now, you see, that's the secret. Not the punch you didn't throw, or the kicks you didn't land. She merely wanted it. Every Slayer... has a death wish.\n[in a flashback, Spike snaps Nikki’s neck]\nSpike: Even you. The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is you've got ties to the world...your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies. They all tie you here, but you're just putting off the inevitable. Sooner or later, you're gonna want it. And the second- the second - that happens...You know I'll be there. I'll slip in... have myself a real good day. Here endeth the lesson.

Ever ask yourself why she's never taken my name off the guest list?\nRiley: Because you're harmless.\nSpike: Oh yeah, right. Takes one to know, I suppose. Least I still got the attitude. What do you got, a piercing glance? Face it, white bread. Buffy's got a type, and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region.

She came into my home, and we talked. We had what in her warped brain probably passes for a civilized conversation. Why? Because she needs something from me. Because I have power over her. You guys didn't come all the way from England to determine whether or not I was good enough to be let back in. You came to beg me to let you back in. To give your jobs, your lives some semblance of meaning.\n...\nBuffy: You're Watchers. Without a Slayer, you're pretty much just watchin' Masterpiece Theater. You can't stop Glory. You can't do anything with the information you have except maybe publish it in the Everyone Thinks We're Insane-O's Home Journal. So here's how it's gonna work.

The only thing Willow was ever good for...the only thing I ever had going for me were those moments...just moments...where Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. And that will never happen again.\n...\nDark Willow: [to Buffy] Please! This is your pitch? You hate it here as much as I do! I'm just more honest about it. You're trying to sell me on the world? The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them? Where you screw a vampire just to feel and insane asylums are the comfy alternative? This world? Buffy, it's me! I know you were happier when you were in the ground. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life was when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back. You know, with magic?",

Where would the Justice League have been if they hadn't put their differences aside to stop the Imperium and his shape-shifting alien horde?\nBuffy: Don't help me.",
  "Willow: Last time I tried using magic... the First, it turned it around on me, got inside. I felt it surging through me, every fibre of my being, pure undiluted evil. I could taste it.\nKennedy: How's evil taste?\nWillow: A little chalky.",
  "Buffy: [on the phone at work] Well, I'm sorry Xander...next time, close the door when you take a shower at my house...of course they're curious!",
  "Willow: The smell will lead us to the potential.\nXander: Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.",
  "Andrew: Plucked from an ordinary life, handed a destiny\nXander: Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.\n...\nAndrew: It's like—well, it's almost like this metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? The sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and-\nXander: I'll pay you to talk about Star Wars again.",
  "Vi: It's like a gay bar...but with demons.",
  "Xander: They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary.\nDawn: Maybe that's your power.\nXander: What?\nDawn: Seeing, knowing.\nXander: Maybe it is... Maybe I should get a cape.",
  "Buffy: I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls, to understand the source of their power, and know how to use it right.\nGiles: I don't think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking. It's frightening and it's difficult. Then, apparently someone told them that the vision quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey.. until a spooky rasta mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles.",
  "Kennedy: Let's start with the easy stuff. How long have you known... that you were gay?\nWillow: Wait. That's easy? And what, you just assume that I'm gay. I mean, presume much?\nKennedy: Okay, sorry. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?\nWillow: Hey! What, you think you have some sort of special lesbo-dar or something?\nKennedy: Okay, you know there's a better word for that, right?",
  "[Spike lies bleeding because of his malfunctioning control chip.]\nBuffy: Well, we'll fix it. We'll hit serious research mode—\nSpike: Good. Try Behavioral Modification Software Throughout the Ages.\nBuffy: [sighs] Okay. You're right. Not a book thing. [pauses] It's a phone thing.\nSpike: Who you gonna call?\n[Buffy looks askance at him.]\nSpike: God, that phrase is never gonna be usable again, is it?\nBuffy: Doubt it.",
  "Giles: Now wait a minute—you think I'm evil... if I bring a group of girls on a camping trip and don't touch them?",
  "Soldier: Miss Summers! Agent Finn reported that you tried to contact him earlier today.\nBuffy: I knew it! [whispers to Spike] Government conspiracy.\nSoldier: He indicated you might be needing our assistance. We're to provide you anything you need to help Ass-Face here.\n[Spike and Buffy stare at him.]\nSoldier: Those were his exact words, ma'am.",
  "Buffy: You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil by doing evil. I know that.",
  "Lissa: I can't even figure out if I've got the right kind of rope.\nXander: That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, or, you know, recreational -- by which I mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing -- not for tying someone up for sexy, funky fun... In conclusion, rope can be useful in various ways.",
  "Robin: Well, then, I'd, um, I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to dinner if you enjoy having a job.

I'll draw up the paperwork.",
  "Buffy: [about a date with Principal Wood] Or it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good job.\nWillow: [laughs heartily, then sees Buffy's look] Right, that makes sense too.\nBuffy: Or maybe he knows I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out to kill me.\nWillow: Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.\nBuffy: You know, it’s not even that he’s acting that suspicious. It’s just - there he is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That’s got to be like being showered with evil. Only from underneath.\nWillow: Not really a shower.\nBuffy: A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.\n...\nWillow: I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on.",
  "Spike: I should move out. Leave town before it is time for me.\nBuffy: No, you have to stay.\nSpike: You've got another demon fighter now.\nBuffy: That's not why I need you here.\nSpike: Is that right? Why's that, then?\nBuffy: Because I'm not ready for you not to be here.",
  "Spike: Would you let it go? You're like a dog with a bone.\nAnya: So what?\nSpike: It's my bone! Just drop it.",

Well, Buffy, I see our preparations for the... school... pep-dance-cheer-drill-contest are really coming along. \"Bring it on!\"\nBuffy: Will, it's okay, he knows.\nWillow: Oh, thank God. If I had to explain all these weapons? I had nothing.\nRobin: Buffy tells me you have been, umm... oh, how shall I put it?... experimenting... [long embarrassed pause] ...with the magics.\nWillow: Oh! Yeah. Oh, nothing too heavy, though. Just the lighter, safer stuff. Uh, if Kennedy asks, her pointy stuff's right there. See you inside.

But let's not try to forget, we're also your friends.\nAnya: I'm not.\nBuffy: Then why are you here? Aside from getting rescued, what is that you do?\nAnya: I provide much needed... sarcasm.\nXander: Um... that'd kinda be my job actually.",
  "[The scene opens with a Masterpiece Theatre-like setting, with Andrew reading a book.]\nAndrew: Oh, hello there, gentle viewers.\n[He closes the book.]\nAndrew: You caught me catching up on an old favorite. It's wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it? Adventure and heroics and discovery — don't they just take you away? Come with me now, if you will, gentle viewers. Join me on a new voyage of the mind. A little tale I like to call... Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyrs.",
  "[A vampire knocks Buffy to the ground. Cut to Andrew in his \"study.\"]\nAndrew: Ouch! My goodness! Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they? She didn't see that second vampire, concealed by cover of darkness, ready—\n[There's a knock at the door, which Andrew ignores.]\nAndrew: ... ready to attack and make her his own vampirical spawn.\n[Cut to the bathroom, where Andrew sits on the closed toilet, trying to continue his narration.]\nAndrew: Let's rejoin them now to see—\n[Suddenly, Anya barges in.]\nAnya: For God's sakes, Andrew! You've been in here for 30 minutes. What are you doing?\nAndrew: Entertaining and educating.\nAnya: Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?",
  "Buffy: Are you still filming me? Stop!\nAndrew: But it’s a valuable record. An important document for the ages. A Slayer in action.\nBuffy: A nerd in pain. Would they like that? ’cause we could do that.",
  "Andrew: It’s a full house. I think it’s a good time to do some introductions, don’t you, gentle viewers?\n...\nAndrew: [bright fantasy shot, clear, emotional voice] You’ve already met Buffy. She’s beautiful, with a lion’s heart and the face of an angel. She’s never afraid because she knows her side will always win. [Spike enters shot, somehow shirtless] Buffy and Spike have some kind of history. You can feel the heat between them although, technically as a vampire, he’s room-temperature. [Anya enters shot, eating grapes] Anya. A feisty waif with a fiery temper and a vulnerable heart that she hides even from herself. [pan to unnamed Potential Slayer eating cereal] This lovely girl... [uncertain - back to normal voice] I don't remember her name.",

  "Buffy: [about the school] Situation still normal. Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.\nRobin: So it appears.\nBuffy: Well, no fires, no one's heads going kablooey. And the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy seething resentment.",
  "Buffy: Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.\nGiles: Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.\nBuffy: Giles, what's wrong?\nGiles: Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not a book to be seen. I - I don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who do we speak to?\nRobin: Uh, that would - that would be me. Hi. I'm Robin Wood.\nGiles: Oh, sorry. Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're something of a freelance demon fighter. [Robin closes door] Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously low on allies.\nBuffy: So, we didn't stop it, then?\nGiles: Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. [regarding the library] So, we should go before the school board.",
  "Buffy: So, did you bring back any Potentials?\nGiles: Um, rea— no. Actually, m-my, uh, my trip is about something else. It's–it's, um, regarding Spike.\nBuffy: Spike. What about him?\nGiles: I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose to remove the chip from his head.\nRobin: Wait, sorry — chip?\nGiles: Well, uh, it's a... long story.\nBuffy: The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.\nGiles: And that would be the abridged version.\nBuffy: But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.\nGiles: Unless the First triggers him again.\nRobin: Triggers the chip?\nBuffy: No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It was... made him… He was killing again.\nRobin: So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?\nGiles: Not anymore!\nBuffy: It was killing him, Giles!\nRobin: The trigger?\nBuffy: No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.\nRobin: Because the military gave him a soul?\n[Giles tries to think an adequate response. Buffy glares at Robin, who gestures in surrender.]\nRobin: Uh... sorry.",
  "Kennedy: So, Spike's trigger's been active this entire time?\nRona: How can Buffy take this for granted? I mean, he lives in our house, we train with him.\nAnya: Don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could slaughter a hundred frat boys, and... [everyone shoots a look at Anya] Forgiveness makes us human, blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.",

  "Faith: Whatcha wanna do to her, vamp? Huh? Somthin' like this? [punches Spike]\nSpike: (stands) Nice punch you got there. Lemme guess. Leather pants, nice right cross, doe eyes, holier-than-thou glower...you must be Faith.\nFaith: [shrugs and grins] Oh, goodie. I'm famous.\nSpike: Told you were coming. Bit of a misunderstanding here. I'm—\nFaith: Spike. [nods] Yeah, we've met before.\nSpike: We have? I don't think we— [Faith kicks Spike in the torso] Bloody hell! What're you doing? I'm on your side.\nFaith: Yeah? Maybe you haven't heard. I've reformed. [punches Spike]\nSpike: So have I. [punches Faith] I reformed way before you did. [Faith punches Spike] Stop... [punches Faith] hitting... [punches Faith again] me! We're on the same side.\nFaith: Please. You think I'm stupid?\nSpike: Well, yeah. [grins]\nFaith: You were attacking that girl. [punches Spike]\n[Someone punches Faith in the face, knocking her down. Pan over to show it's Buffy.]\nBuffy: [innocently] Sorry, Faith. I didn't realize that was you.\nFaith: It's all right, B. Luckily, you still punch like you used to.\nBuffy: You OK?\nSpike: Yeah. Terrific.\nFaith: [to Buffy] You're protecting vampires? Are you the bad slayer now? Am I the good slayer now?\nBuffy: He's with me. He has a soul.\nFaith: Oh, he's like Angel?\nSpike: No!\nBuffy: Sort of.\nSpike: I am nothing like Angel.\nBuffy: He fights on my side. Which is more than I can say for some of us.\nSpike: Angel's dull as a table lamp! And we have very different coloring.\nFaith: Yeah, well if he's so good, what's he doing chasing down defenseless—\n[The young woman that Spike was chasing stands up, growls, and attacks Faith, knocking her down.]\nBuffy: That's one of the bad guys.\nFaith: You should make 'em wear a sign.",
  "Caleb: \"Drink of this, for it is my blood.\" You know, I always loved the story of the Last Supper. The body and blood of Christ becoming rich, red wine. I recall, as a boy, though, I couldn't help but think: what would happen if you were at the Last Supper, and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin. I mean, would he make that out of his lymph or some-all? Never did bring it up. Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish. Just looking for answers. Just looking for the Lord in the wrong damn places. Then you showed me the light.",
  "Faith: Every guy's got some whack fantasy. Scratch the surface of any granola-type dude - naughty nurses and horny cheerleaders... I figure, if you can't beat 'em—\nSpike: Join 'em.\nFaith: Just don't forget who's on top.\nSpike: That, I suspect, would be you.",
  "Xander: I've been through more battles with Buffy than you all can ever imagine. She's stopped everything that's ever come up against her. [Buffy and Faith walk in] She's laid down her life -— literally -— to protect the people around her. This girl has died two times, and she's still standing. You're scared? That's smart. You got questions? You should. But you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's all about the kill, then you take the little bus to battle... I've seen her heart, and this time, not literally. And I'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives than you will ever know. You gotta trust her. She's earned it.\nFaith: Damn. I never knew you were that cool.\nBuffy: Well, you always were a little slow.",
  "Caleb: [to Faith] Well, you're the other one, aren't you. You're Cain to her Abel. No offense meant to Cain, of course.\nFaith: I never was one for the good book.\nCaleb: Oh, it has its moments.",
  "Xander: I might need a parrot.\nWillow: Huh?\nXander: Well, to go with the eyepatch, to really complete the look. I think I still have that costume from Halloween.\nWillow: Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a two-body-parts-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal.\nXander: Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch \"Jaws 3-D\" again.",
  "Anya: Okay... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiancé than killing time here with you people in this overcrowded and, might I add, increasingly ripe-smelling basement.

Andrew jots down \"breakup sex\" on the board.]",

  "Andrew: You sure you don't wanna stop and pick up some burgers or something, you know, road trip food?\nSpike: It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.\nAndrew: Right. Right. Gotcha... I—I bet even covert operatives eat curly fries. They're really good.\nSpike: Not as good as those onion blossom things.\nAndrew: Ooh, I love those.\nSpike: Yeah, me, too.\nAndrew: It's an onion... and it's a flower. I—I don't understand how such a thing is possible.\nSpike: See, the genius of it is, you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its shape. Then you deep-fry it root-side up for about 5 minutes.\nAndrew: Masterful.\nSpike: Yeah. Tell anyone we had this conversation, I'll bite you.\nAndrew: Right.",
  "Anya: And it's automatically you. You really do think you're better than we are.\nBuffy: No, I—\nAnya: But we don't know. We don't know if you're actually better. I mean, you came into the world with certain advantages, sure. I mean, that's the legacy.\nBuffy: I—\nAnya: But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.",
  "Kennedy: All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how and when we lose our necks.\nRobin: Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about the \"losing of the necks\" bit.\nAnya: Let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door, repeatedly ringing the doorbell, like maniacal Girl Scouts trying to make quota.",
  "Buffy: We were never close. You just wanted me because I was... unattainable.\nSpike: You think that's all that was?\nBuffy: Please, let's not go over the past.\nSpike: Oh, no, no! Oh, let's hold on here! I've hummed along to your pity ditty. I think I should have the mic for a bit.\nBuffy: Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.\nSpike: You're insufferable.\nBuffy: Thank you. That really helped.\nSpike: I'm not tryin' to cheer you up.\nBuffy: Then what are you trying to say?\nSpike: I don't know! I'll know when I'm done sayin' it. Something pissed me off, and I just-- \"unattainable,\" that's it.\nBuffy: Fine. I'm attainable. I'm a-- I'm an \"attain-a-thon.\" May I please just go to sleep?\nSpike: You listen to me. I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. Don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood... which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred-plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of. You... Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say I love you, it's not because I want you, or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are. What you do. How you try. I've seen your kindness, and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you, and I understand, with perfect clarity, exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the One, Buffy.\nBuffy: I don't want to be the One.\nSpike: I don't want to be this good-looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear.",
  "Robin: That's exactly what The First does. Finds your Achilles' heel.\nFaith: Nah, it just talked to me. What? It does a heel thing, too?\nRobin: It's a phrase. Your weak spot.\nFaith: Oh. The school thing. I was kind of absent that decade.",
  "Andrew: Hi, everybody. I missed you guys a lot. Sorry we took so long getting back from our mission... But we had to wait out the sun and, well, I think our mission went very well. We rode on Spike's hog, which was very cool, and played some amusing games and, oh, we got some information. But do you know what? I really need to urinate.",
  "The First (as Buffy): I envy them. Isn't that the strangest thing?\nCaleb: Well, it does throw me just a tad. I mean, they're barely more than animals. Feedin' off each other's flesh, it's nauseatin'. But you, you're everywhere. You're in the hearts of little children. You're in the souls of the rich. You're the fire that makes people kill and hate. The fire that will cure the world of weakness. They're just sinners. You are sin.\nThe First (as Buffy): I do enjoy your sermons.\nCaleb: And you're in me. Gave me strength no man can have.\nThe First (as Buffy): You're the only man strong enough to BE my vessel and I know you feel me, but... I know why they grab at each other. To feel. I want to feel. I want to wrap my hands around some innocent neck and feel it crack.\nCaleb: Amen.",
  "Buffy: I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is that it made Caleb back off in a hurry.\nWillow: [to Giles] So it's true. Scythe matters.",
  "Faith: There's only supposed to be one. Maybe that's why you and I can never get along. We're not supposed to exist together.\nBuffy: Also, you went evil and were killing people.\nFaith: Good point. Also a factor.\nBuffy: But you're right. I mean, like... I guess everyone's alone, but... being a Slayer? There's a burden we can't share.\nFaith: And no one else can feel it... Thank God we're hot chicks with superpowers.\nBuffy: Takes the edge off.\nFaith: [nods] Comforting.",
  "Anya: And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die, which they-they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is clearly insane... and yet here's the thing. When it's something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do! They never... they never quit. So I guess I'll keep fighting too.\nAndrew: That was kind of beautiful. You, you love humans.\nAnya: I do not.\nAndrew: Yes you do. [singing] You love them.",
  "Ancient Woman: You pulled it out of the rock. I was one of those who put it in there.\nBuffy: What is it?\nAncient Woman: [admires the scythe] A weapon. A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you who... I'm sorry. What's your name?\nBuffy: Buffy.\nAncient Woman: No, really. [Buffy shrugs] We forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from the Shadow Men, who—\nBuffy: Yeah. Met those guys. Didn't really care too much for 'em.\nAncient Woman: Ahh, yes, then you know. And they became the watchers. And the watchers watched the slayers. But we were watching them.\nBuffy: Oh! So you're like... what are you?\nAncient Woman: Guardians. Women who want to help and protect you. We forged this centuries ago, halfway around the world.\nBuffy: Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.\nAncient Woman: Forged there, it was put to use right here... to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the Earth. The rest were already driven under. And then there were men here, and then there were monks. And then there was a town, and now there was you. And the scythe remained hidden.\nBuffy: I don't understand. How is it possible that we didn't know any of this?\nGuardian: We hid, too. We had to, until now. We're the last surprise.",
  "Guardian: One way or another, it can only mean an end is truly near.\nCaleb: [grabs guardian's head from behind and snaps her neck] I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part, on account of her neck snapping and all. Did she say the end is near, or here?",
  "Buffy: [about Spike] It's different. He's different. He has a soul now... What?\nAngel: That's great! Everyone's got a soul now.\nBuffy: He'll make a difference.\nAngel: You know, I started it. The whole having-a-soul. Before it was... all the cool new thing.\nBuffy: Oh my god, are you twelve?\nAngel: I'm getting the brush-off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring out the champion in me.\nBuffy: You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?\nAngel: Aha! [points] Boyfriend!",

Oh, and, uh, for the record, our little encounter didn't exactly change my world.\nFaith: [stops grinning] You're trippin'! That was rock 'em, sock 'em!\nRobin: No, no, no, no! It was, it was nice enough, you know, and-and you're, you're very, um, um, enthused, and, I think with a little more experience, you—\nFaith: Dude, I got mad skills!\nRobin: Yeah, of course. Let's finish up.\nFaith: [takes off her belt] Oh, hell with that! We're going again, baby. You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.\nRobin: Faith, [laughs] make me a deal, all right? We live through this, you give me the chance to surprise you.\nFaith: What would be the surprise?\nRobin: You... do know the meaning of the word, right?\nFaith: Fine. Deal.\nRobin: Good enough. [goes back to work]\nFaith: No way you're prettier than me.\nRobin: Little bit, yeah.",
  "Buffy: So here's the part where you make a choice. What if you could have that power, now? In every generation, one Slayer is born, because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. [points to Willow] This woman... is more powerful than all of them combined. [Willow whimpers] So I say we change the rule. I say my power... should be our power. Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence of the Scythe to change our destiny. From now on, every girl in the world who might be a Slayer, will be a Slayer. Every girl who could have the power, will have the power, can stand up, will stand up. Slayers... every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?\nVi: These guys are dust.",
  "Buffy: So, what do you guys wanna do tomorrow?\nWillow: Nothing strenuous.\nXander: Well, mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.\nGiles: I think we can do better than that.\nBuffy: I was thinking about shopping. As per usual.\nWillow: Oh. There's an Arden B. in the new mall.\nXander: Oh, good. I could use a few items.\nGiles: Well, now aren't we gonna discuss this? Save the world or go to the mall?\nBuffy: I'm having a wicked shoe craving.\nXander: Aren't you on the patch?\nWillow: Those never work.\nBuffy: Never.\nGiles: And here I am, invisible to the eye, not having any vote.\nXander: See, I need a new look. It's this whole eye patch thing.\nBuffy: Oh, you could go with full black secret agent look.\nWillow: Or the puffy shirt, pirate slash...\nGiles: The Earth is definitely doomed.",

  "Faith: Looks like the Hellmouth is officially closed for business.\nGiles: There's another one in Cleveland.
