  "A bug is never just a mistake. It represents something bigger. An error of thinking. That makes you who you are. - Elliot Alderson",
  "A simple program, a worm that can make data unreadable, malware that took Darlene maybe two hours to code. Is that really all it takes to kill the world? - Elliot Alderson",
  "Am I crazy not to like this guy? Among some of his Facebook likes are George W. Bush’s Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban. Must I really justify myself any further? - Elliot Alderson",
  "Choices. Maybe Mr. Robot’s right. That’s what this is all about, the yesses and nos of life. But do we decide them or do they decide us? - Elliot Alderson",
  "Continuously getting legit refills isn’t realistic, and neither is being a junkie. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Daemons, they call them. They perform action without user interaction. Monitoring, logging, notifications. Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits. They’re always there, always active. We can try to be right, we can try to be good. We can try to make a difference, but it’s all bullshit. ‘Cause intentions are irrelevant. They don’t drive us. Daemons do. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Daemons. They don’t stop working. They’re always active. They seduce. They manipulate. They own us. And even though you’re with me, even though I created you, it makes no difference. We all must deal with them alone. The best we can hope for, the only silver lining in all of this is that when we break through, we find a few familiar faces waiting on the other side. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Don’t ever make decisions when you’re on morphine. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Dwelling is so inefficient. - Whiterose",
  "Even extraordinary people, and I believe you are, are driven by human banalities. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "Every day, we change the world, but to change the world in a way that means anything, that takes more time than most people have. It never happens all at once. It’s slow. It’s methodical. It’s exhausting. We don’t all have the stomach for it. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Every hacker has her fixation. You hack people, I hack time. So you should know that when I set a time line, there’s a reason. - Whiterose",
  "Every hacker loves attention. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "Hackers. We inherently trust no one, including each other. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Hello, friend. Hello, friend. That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name. But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that. - Elliot Alderson",
  "How do we know if we’re in control? That we’re not just making the best of what comes at us, and that’s it. Trying to constantly pick between two options. Like your two paintings in the waiting room. Or Coke and Pepsi. McDonald’s or Burger King? Hyundai or Honda? It’s all part of the same blur, right? Just out of focus enough. It’s the illusion of choice. Half of us can’t even pick our own our cable, gas, electric. The water we drink, our health insurance. Even if we did, would it matter? You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue Shield, what the fuck is the difference? In fact, aren’t they the same? No, man, our choices are prepaid for us, long time ago. - Elliot Alderson",
  "I’m good at reading people. My secret, I look for the worst in them. - Elliot Alderson",
  "I’ve never found it hard to hack most people. If you listen to them, watch them, their vulnerabilities are like a neon sign screwed into their heads. - Elliot Alderson",
  "I hurt Krista. I don’t feel good about that. I hope you’re not mad at me. But you have to admit, she’s just like everyone else. Too afraid to peak over their walls for fear of what they might see. Not me. That’s what I do. I look. - Elliot Alderson",
  "If they lock me up, the kind of door they close don’t matter. - Fernando Vera",
  "If you want to change things, perhaps you should try from within, because this is what happens from the outside. - Terry Colby",
  "In business, grudges aren’t really a thing. It’s too emotional. - Terry Colby",
  "Is any of it real? I mean, look at this. Look at it! A world built on fantasy! Synthetic emotions in the form of pills, psychological warfare in the form of advertising, mind-altering chemicals in the form of food, brainwashing seminars in the form of media, controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks. Real? You want to talk about reality? We haven’t lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century. We turned it off, took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of GMOs while we tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding dumpster of the human condition. We live in branded houses trademarked by corporations built on bipolar numbers jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen. You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo, before you can find anything real. We live in a kingdom of bullshit, a kingdom you’ve lived in for far too long. So don’t tell me about not being real. I’m no less real than the fucking beef patty in your Big Mac. - Mr. Robot",
  "Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children? Or maybe it’s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit. The world itself’s just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money. I’m not saying anything new, we all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy but because we wanna be sedated. Because it’s painful not to pretend, because we’re cowards. Fuck society. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Life is so much easier when you’re numb. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Most coders think debugging software is about fixing a mistake, but that’s bullshit. Debugging’s actually all about finding the bug, about understanding why the bug was there to begin with, about knowing that its existence was no accident. It came to you to deliver a message, like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface, popping with a revelation you’ve secretly known all along. - Elliot Alderson",
  "No rest for the wicked. - Mr. Robot",
  "Old habits, they die hard. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "People always make the best exploits. - Elliot Alderson",
  "People are all just people, right? When it gets down to it, everyone’s the same. They love something. They want something. They fear something. Specifics help, but specifics don’t change the way that everyone is vulnerable. It just changes the way that we access those vulnerabilities. - Mobley",
  "People walk around, act like they know what hate means. Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself. I mean truly hate yourself. That’s power. - Fernando Vera",
  "People who get violent get that way because they can’t communicate. - Mr. Robot",
  "Power belongs to the people that take it. Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions, or rightful qualifications, no. The actual will to take is often the only thing that’s necessary. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "So this is what a revolution looks like, people in expensive clothing running around. Not how I pictured it. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Sometimes it’s hard to listen to an explanation, even when it’s from myself. Especially when it’s from myself. It would be so much easier to only pay attention when I needed to. - Elliot Alderson",
  "Sure, there are grays, but when you come right down to it, at its core, beneath every choice, there’s either a one or a zero. You either do something or you don’t. You walk out that door, you’ve decided to do nothing, to say no, which means you do not come back. You leave, you are no longer a part of this. You become a zero. If you stay, if you want to change the world, you become a yes. You become a one. So, I’ll ask you again: are you a one or a zero? - Mr. Robot",
  "The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it. Work around it or work through it. No matter what, it changes. It becomes something new. The next version. The inevitable upgrade. - Elliot Alderson",
  "The concept of waiting bewilders me. There are always deadlines. There are always ticking clocks. That’s why you must manage your time. - Whiterose",
  "The devil’s at his strongest while we’re looking the other way, like a program running in the background silently, while we’re busy doing other shit. - Elliot Alderson",
  "The lock pick. Every hacker’s favorite sport. The perfect system to crack, mostly because unlike virtual systems, when you break it, you can feel it. You can see it. You can hear it. - Elliot Alderson",
  "The world is a dangerous place, Elliot, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. - Mr. Robot",
  "There’s a smart time to be scared, bro… And a stupid time. - Fernando Vera",
  "This is the world we live in. People relying on each other’s mistakes to manipulate one another and use one another, even relate to one another. A warm, messy circle of humanity. - Elliot Alderson",
  "True courage is about being honest with yourself. Especially when it’s difficult. - Mr. Robot",
  "Two days ago I strangled a woman to death just with my hands. That’s a strange sensation. Something so tremendous done by something so simple. The first ten seconds were uncomfortable, a feeling of limbo, but then your muscles tense, and she struggles and fights, but it almost disappears in the background along with everything else in the world. At that moment it’s just you and absolute power, nothing else. That moment stayed with me. I thought I’d feel guilty for being a murderer, but I don’t. I feel wonder. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "Unfortunately, we’re all human. Except me, of course. - Tyrell Wellick",
  "We’re all living in each other’s paranoia. - Elliot Alderson",
  "We don’t want to hurt them! We want to kill them! - Mr. Robot",
  "What I’m about to tell you is top secret, a conspiracy bigger than all of us. There’s a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I’m talking about the guys no one knows about, the guys that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission. And now I think they’re following me. - Elliot Alderson",
  "When a bug finally makes itself known, it can be exhilarating, like you just unlocked something. A grand opportunity waiting to be taken advantage of. - Elliot Alderson",
  "When I was a kid I got into web design by ripping off sites I liked. All you had to do was view source on your browser and there it was. The code. You could copy paste it, modify it a little, put your name on it, and like that, it was your site. View source. What if we had that for people? Would people really wanna see? - Elliot Alderson",
  "You’re losing it, kiddo. I’m only supposed to be your prophet. You’re supposed to be my god. - Mr. Robot",
  "You’re never sure about anything unless there’s something to be sure about. - Gideon Goddard",
  "You don’t take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart. That’s the thing about conglomerates, they don’t have hearts. You take them down limb by limb. And as they unravel, their illusion of control unravels. - Mr. Robot",
  "You think people out there are getting exactly what they deserve? No. They’re getting paid over or under, but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled. - Mr. Robot"
